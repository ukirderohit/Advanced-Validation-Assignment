## Advanced Validation Assignment <br>
<br>
0.  Using breast_cancer.csv, create a random forest model that predicts malignant given the other relevant variables.  Use a single holdout (test/train split).  Use Grid Search to optimize model hyperparameters.  Measure the model's performance using AUC, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.<br>

1.  Implement K-Fold Cross Validation, with 10 folds, on your Breast Cancer Model<br>

2.  Report on how the K-Fold CV score compared to your single holdout AUC<br>

3.  Write a short description of your model's performance.   Include AUC, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall in your discussion.<br>

Turn in a github link to your ipython notebook, containing the above three items.<br>
